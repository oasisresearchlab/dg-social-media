    - Title:: Exposure to untrustworthy websites in the 2016 US election
    - Year:: 2020
    - Author(s):: Andrew M. Guess, Brendan Nyhan, Jason Reifler
    - Abstract:: Although commentators frequently warn about echo chambers, little is known about the volume or slant of political misinformation that people consume online, the effects of social media and fact checking on exposure, or the effects of political misinformation on behaviour. Here, we evaluate these questions for websites that publish factually dubious content, which is often described as fake news. Survey and web-traffic data from the 2016 US presidential campaign show that supporters of Donald Trump were most likely to visit these websites, which often spread through Facebook. However, these websites made up a small share of peopleâ€™s information diets on average and were largely consumed by a subset of Americans with strong preferences for pro-attitudinal information. These results suggest that the widespread speculation about the prevalence of exposure to untrustworthy websites has been overstated.

            - **Any relevant CLMs/EVDs to check?** No
                - Hmm in general I think it's not clear to me how directly relevant this paper is to the specific question of polarization and social media. Unless we want to conflate ideological slant somehow with untrustworthiness...
                - I don't see this paper (ref 471) cited in the section on polarization either...
                - So I don't think we want to keep these CLMs and EVDs for this particular QUE. I filed the CLMs under Other/related stuff in the master index
