    - Title:: Bias wanted! Examining people’s information exposure, quality expectations and bias perceptions in the context of the refugees debate among different segments of the German population
    - Year:: 2018
    - Author(s):: Dorothee Arlt, Jens Wolling
    - Abstract:: The growing number of refugees entering Europe since 2015 has quickly ignited a heated public debate on refugees in Germany. Against the backdrop of the media’s information and opinion-forming function, this paper examines the importance of mainstream and social media among different segments of the German population. Applying cluster analysis to survey data ( n = 1,579), six clusters with specific attitude-behavior combinations concerning the refugee issue were identified: Pro-Refugee Activists, Passive-Affirmative Mainstream, Directly-Involved Ambivalents, Passive-Worried Mainstream, Worried Agitators, and Anti-Refugee Activists. The results show that these clusters differ both in terms of socio-demographic and political characteristics as well as in terms of people’s issue-specific media usage, expectations, and evaluations of media coverage. Moreover, the findings indicate that social media play a problematic role in the debate as they seem to reinforce people’s pre-existing attitudes toward refugees. The implications of these findings for public debate on refugees are also discussed.

    - Status::
        - [x] #firstPass by [[Carolina Franca Tristao Batista]]
        - [x] #checked by [[Flavia Batista]]
            - CLM nodes conform to the [CLM style guide](Claim ([[CLM]]) nodes #.sticky): yes
            - CLMs redundant/mergeable with existing CLMs in the Master Index: no
            - EVD nodes conform to the [EVD style guide](Evidence ([[EVD]]) nodes #.sticky): yes
            - All relevant CLM and EVD mappings described: yes
            - Maybe use "polarization" instead of "divide"?
                - Authors use the word "divide" and not "polarized". Can change if it fits better the overall purpose of this work.
            - Missing the bullet point "analysis" which should describe the technique used to analyze the data -- see Joel's example
                - Done.
            - I'd recommend including the evidence in the scratchpad under a bullet point named "key results" instead of including them as part of the EVD --> based on Joel's example
                - Following the @banksPolarizedFeedsThreeExperiments2021 example of figures and quotes in EVD nodes.
        - [x] #checked by [[Joel Chan]]
            - **Any relevant CLMs/EVDs to check?** yes
                - though these ones we'll move to potentially related, don't need to fix deeply for now; seem more about contextualizing levels of polarization, rather than the q of social media and polarization per se
