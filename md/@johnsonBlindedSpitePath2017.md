    - Abstract:: Despite fears that selective exposure and selective avoidance could deepen polarization and negatively affect the democratic process, few studies have directly studied this phenomenon. This study explores whether selective exposure and avoidance to blogs, social network sites, and Twitter directly influence confidence in Congress and the president or more indirectly through polarization. This study suggests that fears of selective exposure, selective avoidance, and polarization infecting the democratic process appear overstated. First, polarization was positively related to confidence in Congress and the president. Second, selective exposure to social media sites strengthens confidence in the president and in Congress. Twitter boosts confidence in Congress. Third, selective avoidance had a negative influence on other measures, which suggests people seek both information that challenges their views as well as ones that supports them. Finally, selective exposure and avoidance proved weak indicators of polarization. Instead, strength of partisanship is the stronger predictor of confidence in Congress and the president.

                        - and then the specific EVDs oppose this positive claim.

                    - [atomic]([[EVD]] nodes, like CLM nodes, should be **atomic**): no, this EVD describes two separate effects
                        - [x] split into separate effects unless they really go together
                            - They go together. It's the same effect. Rephrased.

                        - yes, president and congress ok, can sorta infer US context, but better to include note about US context, and i prefer to use terms from the scale itself, rather than the construct, unless it is a validated scale (e.g., in psych, the implicit association test)
                    - [methodological clarity](**Methodology clarity**: Key methodological details are described, sufficient to understand the result and appraise its support/opposition for various claims):

                            - looking at the actual scale makes clear that they're lumping in blogs and twitter, and not really clarifying/targeting any particular sites
                            - and also makes clear that their polarization construct here is v different from [[[[EVD]] - US survey respondents self-reported greater ideological distance between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton after seeing negative campaign tweets from either candidate, compared to seeing no tweets - [[@banksPolarizedFeedsThreeExperiments2021]]]], which was about ideological distance specifically, rather than general "favorability" (perhaps affective polarization?)
                        - [x] note SEM (but ok since we have the screenshot)
                - [[EVD]] - Respondents are not very polarized, with fewer than one in five scoring high on the polarization scale and this was what happened TEST - [[@johnsonBlindedSpitePath2017]]

            - All relevant CLM and EVD mappings described:
                - only CLMs and EVD directly relevant to focal question: missing a key CLM: something like "Selective exposure and selective avoidance predict polarization, but they are weaker indicators than strength of party ties" (it's more at the construct level)
                - CLM and EVD support/oppose relationships are described: yes, although [see note above](should be restated as CLM - Selective exposure, avoidance and polarization are infecting the democratic process. generalization might even be "polarization has negative effects on the democratic process") about using opposed by instead of supported by
