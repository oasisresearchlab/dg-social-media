            - **Any relevant CLMs/EVDs to check?**
                - yes!
            - **CLMs conform to style guide: block ref in each CLM below and then use the review CLM node roam template for each to review it:**
                - [[[[CLM]] - Twitter users are generally aggregated in homogeneous communities.]]
                    - [atomic and generalized]([[CLM]]s are **atomic, generalized assertions** about the world): yes!
                    - [positive](**Positive Claims**: We primarily write "positive" CLMs, and deal with "negative" claims by way of evidential opposition (EVD Oppose CLM)): small fix
                        - [x] remove reply-to caveat, and change the reply-to-network results to `OpposedBy` to this CLM
                    - [source referenced in body of CLM page](The body of a [[CLM]] page should **list all sources** that assert that [[CLM]], with quotes/screenshots and page numbers (see the [[CLM]] ((UivKdOrY7)))): yes!
                    - [nonredundant with CLMs in master index](**Overlapping Claims**: If CLM asserted by current paper overlaps sufficiently with CLM already in master index, use that instead of making a new one): n/a
            - **EVDs conform to style guide: block ref in each EVD below and then use the review EVD node roam template for each to review it:**
                - [[[[EVD]] - The majority (80-90%)of networks of tweets about the Italian referendum shared links had the same model-estimated stance towards the referendum as the users who shared them. Retweet and quote networks had almost 100% of within-stance. - [[@laiStancePolarityPolitical2019]]]]
                    - [atomic]([[EVD]] nodes, like CLM nodes, should be **atomic**): yes!
                    - [past tense]([[EVD]] descriptions are written in the **past tense**): yes!
                    - [lower level, contextualized description](**Low Level**: Concepts are described at lower level of abstraction that is **closer to the actual observation**): small fixes
                        - [x] could probably rephrase for clarity:
                            - "the majority (80-90%)of networks of tweets about the Italian referendum shared links had the same model-estimated stance towards the referendum as the users who shared them"
                            - see [below]([x] need more details on stance detection) for why to add "model-estimated"
                    - [methodological clarity](**Methodology clarity**: Key methodological details are described, sufficient to understand the result and appraise its support/opposition for various claims): fixes needed
                        - [x] need more details on stance detection
                            - roughly:
                                - made training dataset of manual annotations collected via crowdsourced 968 triplet judgments (section 4)
                                - then train SVM model to predict stance, achieved ~.6-.8 F-measure across the networks (section 5)
                                - crucially, this is what was used to estimate stance in the full dataset used for the EVD
                - [[[[EVD]] - There were no striking divisions between users exposing different stances in the reply-to Twitter network of the Italian referendum. - [[@laiStancePolarityPolitical2019]]]]
                    - [atomic]([[EVD]] nodes, like CLM nodes, should be **atomic**): yes
                    - [past tense]([[EVD]] descriptions are written in the **past tense**): yes
                    - [lower level, contextualized description](**Low Level**: Concepts are described at lower level of abstraction that is **closer to the actual observation**): fixes needed
                        - [x] add back in context of Italian referendum and twitter
                    - [methodological clarity](**Methodology clarity**: Key methodological details are described, sufficient to understand the result and appraise its support/opposition for various claims): fixes needed
                        - [x] need to describe the homophily test and modularity measures pp. 20-21 (beginning of section 7), which are the basis of the results in section 7, including this one
            - **All relevant CLM and EVD mappings described:** some fixes needed
                - missing key results in section 7, esp the homophily test (described on p. 21), and is partially for
                    - can integrate into [[[[EVD]] - The majority (80-90%)of networks of tweets about the Italian referendum shared links had the same model-estimated stance towards the referendum as the users who shared them. Retweet and quote networks had almost 100% of within-stance. - [[@laiStancePolarityPolitical2019]]]]
                - see also request to [x] remove reply-to caveat, and change the reply-to-network results to `OpposedBy` to this CLM

        - [x] #revised by [[Carolina Franca Tristao Batista]]
        - [x] #[[approved]] by [[Joel Chan]]
            - looks good, pending this one: [x] need to describe the homophily test and modularity measures pp. 20-21 (beginning of section 7), which are the basis of the results in section 7, including this one

        - **Participants and setting**: About 900K tweets about the Referendum held in Italy on December 4th, 2016, where citizens were asked to express their opinion towards a reform of the Italian Constitution, collected between November 24th and December 7th.
