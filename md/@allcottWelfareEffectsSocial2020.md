    - Year:: 2020
    - Author(s):: Hunt Allcott, Luca Braghieri, Sarah Eichmeyer, Matthew Gentzkow
    - Abstract:: <jats:p> The rise of social media has provoked both optimism about potential societal benefits and concern about harms such as addiction, depression, and political polarization. In a randomized experiment, we find that deactivating Facebook for the four weeks before the 2018 US midterm election (i) reduced online activity, while increasing offline activities such as watching TV alone and socializing with family and friends; (ii) reduced both factual news knowledge and political polarization; (iii) increased subjective well-being; and post-experiment Facebook use. Deactivation reduced post-experiment valuations of Facebook, suggesting that traditional metrics may overstate consumer surplus. (JEL D12, D72, D90, I31, L82, L86, Z13) </jats:p>

    - Status::
        - [x] #firstPass by [[Carolina Franca Tristao Batista]]
        - [x] #checked by [[Flavia Batista]]
            - CLM nodes conform to the [CLM style guide](Claim ([[CLM]]) nodes #.sticky): for the second CLM node, very general - which measures???
                - Done. Changed CLM wording and clarified in EVD.
            - CLMs redundant/mergeable with existing CLMs in the Master Index: Nice.
            - EVD nodes conform to the [EVD style guide](Evidence ([[EVD]]) nodes #.sticky): include evidence for each CLM nodes
                - All CLM nodes already had EVD nodes. Following @banksPolarizedFeedsThreeExperiments2021 model. No change was made following this comment.
            - All relevant CLM and EVD mappings described: yes.
            - In the scratchpad, I'd just include a bullet for key claims before getting to participants and settings.
                - Key claims are in CLM nodes.
            - Missing "analysis" as a bullet point -- see Joel's example
                - Done
            - I'd recommend including figures and quotes from the readings in the scratchpad under a bullet point named "key results" instead of including them as part of the EVD --> based on Joel's example
                - Following @banksPolarizedFeedsThreeExperiments2021 example of figures and quotes on EVD. No change was made following this comment.

                    - [positive](**Positive Claims**: We primarily write "positive" CLMs, and deal with "negative" claims by way of evidential opposition (EVD Oppose CLM)): yes!

                - [[[[EVD]] - Deactivating facebook reduced various measures of political polarization, particularly exposure to news that improve understanding of their own political party (vs. other party), and issue polarization, but not affective polarization. - [[@allcottWelfareEffectsSocial2020]]]]
                    - [atomic]([[EVD]] nodes, like CLM nodes, should be **atomic**): some fixes needed
                        - [ ] i think congenial news exposure, issue polarization, and political polarization index are quite different measures and constructs, so might be separated; should at least clarify that these are all various indices of political polarization, though they are conceptually distinct
                            - see argument in footnote 23
                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdg-social-media-polarization%2F7fX6P_ky8m.45.17%402x.png?alt=media&token=f177b058-b98c-4ace-acb6-9722f1090668) (p. 651)
                            - easiest would be to say something like "deactivating facebook reduced various measures of political polarization, particularly exposure to news that improve understanding of their own political party (vs. other party), and issue polarization, but not affective polarization"
                                - because it is significant that affective polarization is not significantly affected here, and is noticeably less negative than the other measures
                            - alternatively, could separate out the statistically significant from significant ones as separate EVD notes, and maybe also separate out conceptual clusters
                                - deactivating facebook reduced exposure to news that improved understanding of their own political party (vs. other party)
                                - deactivating facebook reduced the extent to which respondent’s issue opinions aligned with the average opinion in their own party (vs. other party)
                                - deactivating facebook did not result in statistically significant reductions in measures of affective political polarization
                    - [past tense]([[EVD]] descriptions are written in the **past tense**): yes
                    - [lower level, contextualized description](**Low Level**: Concepts are described at lower level of abstraction that is **closer to the actual observation**): some fixes needed
                        - [x] please include screenshots of text describing result also
                        - [x] would be great to use the operationalizations instead of the constructs (e.g., congenial news exposure --> exposure to news that improved understanding of their own political party), unless they are standardized scales
                    - [methodological clarity](**Methodology clarity**: Key methodological details are described, sufficient to understand the result and appraise its support/opposition for various claims): some fixes needed
                        - [x] add back in missing context about the various political polarization measures (beyond the party affective polarization operationalization in [this screenshot](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdg-social-media-polarization%2FAIfnRoLRes.24.40%20PM.png?alt=media&token=2797a948-4baa-4117-9764-38203ca0dabe)
