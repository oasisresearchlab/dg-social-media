    - Title:: Do Search Algorithms Endanger Democracy? An Experimental Investigation of Algorithm Effects on Political Polarization
    - Year:: 2020
    - Author(s):: Jaeho Cho, Saifuddin Ahmed, Martin Hilbert, Billy Liu, Jonathan Luu
    - Abstract:: This study examines algorithm effects on user opinion, utilizing a real-world recommender algorithm of a highly popular video-sharing platform, YouTube. We experimentally manipulate user search/watch history by our custom programming. A controlled laboratory experiment is then conducted to examine whether exposure to algorithmically recommended content reinforces and polarizes political opinions. Results suggest that political self-reinforcement, as indicated by the political emotion-ideology alignment, and affective polarization are heightened by political videos – selected by the YouTube recommender algorithm – based on participants’ own search preferences. Suggestions for how to reduce algorithm-induced political polarization and implications of algorithmic personalization for democracy are discussed.
