    - Title:: Social Media, News Consumption, and Polarization: Evidence from a Field Experiment
    - Year:: 2021
    - Author(s):: Ro’ee Levy
    - Abstract:: <jats:p> Does the consumption of ideologically congruent news on social media exacerbate polarization? I estimate the effects of social media news exposure by conducting a large field experiment randomly offering participants subscriptions to conservative or liberal news outlets on Facebook. I collect data on the causal chain of media effects: subscriptions to outlets, exposure to news on Facebook, visits to online news sites, and sharing of posts, as well as changes in political opinions and attitudes. Four main findings emerge. First, random variation in exposure to news on social media substantially affects the slant of news sites that individuals visit. Second, exposure to counter-attitudinal news decreases negative attitudes toward the opposing political party. Third, in contrast to the effect on attitudes, I find no evidence that the political leanings of news outlets affect political opinions. Fourth, Facebook’s algorithm is less likely to supply individuals with posts from counter-attitudinal outlets, conditional on individuals subscribing to them. Together, the results suggest that social media algorithms may limit exposure to counter-attitudinal news and thus increase polarization. (JEL C93, D72, L82) </jats:p>

            - **Claims**
                - Exposure to ideologically aligned news on social media does not strongly affect political opinions. (p. 859, lines 167-169)
                    - Supported by: The effect of the treatments on a political opinions index was small and not statistically significant. (p. 859, lines 167-169)
                - Exposure to counter-attitudinal news decreases affective polarization. (p. 860, lines 173-175)
                    - Supported by: The counter-attitudinal treatment decreased the affective polarization index compared to the pro-attitudinal treatment. (p. 860, lines 173-175)
                - Facebook's algorithm limits exposure to counter-attitudinal news. (p. 864, lines 198-201)
                    - Supported by: Participants assigned to counter-attitudinal subscriptions had lower exposure to those outlets despite subscribing.

                - According to regression analysis, "The combined intention-to-treat (ITT) effects of the liberal and conservative treatments on the slant of news sites visited in the two weeks following the intervention is 14 percent of the difference in the slant of sites visited by liberals and conservatives in the control group."
                    - (p. 855, lines 146-149)
                - According to regression analysis, "The ITT and treatment-on-treated (TOT) effects of the counter-attitudinal treatment on the affective polarization index, compared to the pro-attitudinal treatment, are −0.03 and −0.06 standard deviations, respectively."

            - **Practical Implications**
                - Nudges diversifying news exposure on social media can mitigate polarization
                    - (p. 863, lines 192-193)
                - Improving algorithms, nudging diverse subscriptions, and modifying algorithms to encourage serendipity could increase news diversity

            - **Theoretical Implications**
                - Not explicitly discussed
            - **Limitations**
                - Did not observe full news consumption across mediums like TV
                    - (p. 868, lines 249-251)
                - Collected Facebook and browsing data primarily on computers
                    - (p. 868, lines 251-253)
                - High endline survey attrition could affect results
                    - (p. 868, lines 254-256)
                - Did not randomize exposure to moderate outlets
                    - (p. 868, lines 259-260)
                - Intervention done during specific time period (Trump presidency)
                    - (p. 868, lines 263-266)
                - Estimated effects over weeks/months; long-term effects unclear
                    - (p. 868, lines 269-270)
            - **Future Research**
                - Analyze long-term effects of diversified news exposure
                    - (p. 868, line 273)
                - Study other collaborative and content-based recommendation algorithms
                    - (p. 868, line 275)
                - Explore user interface designs to correct algorithmic bias
                    - (p. 868, line 277)
        - **Flavia**
            - **Key Claims**:
                - First, random variation in exposure to news on social media substantially affects the slant of news sites that individuals visit.
                - Second, exposure to counter-attitudinal news decreases negative attitudes toward the opposing political party (polarization claim).
                - Third, in contrast to the effect on attitudes, I find no evidence that the political leanings of news outlets affect political opinions.
                - Fourth, Facebook’s algorithm is less likely to supply individuals with posts from counter-attitudinal outlets, conditional on individuals subscribing to them (polarization claim).
                - Together, the results suggest that social media algorithms may limit exposure to counter-attitudinal news and thus increase polarization.
            - **Participants and setting**: Large online field experiment in which American Facebook users were recruited using Facebook ads.
