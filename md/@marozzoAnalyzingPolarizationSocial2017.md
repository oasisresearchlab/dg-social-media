    - Title:: Analyzing polarization of social media users and news sites during political campaigns
    - Year:: 2017
    - Author(s):: Fabrizio Marozzo, Alessandro Bessi
    - Abstract:: Social media analysis is a fast growing research area aimed at extracting useful information from social networks. Recent years have seen a great interest from academic and business world in using social media to measure public opinion. This paper presents a methodology aimed at discovering the behavior of social network users and how news sites are used during political campaigns characterized by the rivalry of different factions. As a case study, we present an analysis on the constitutional referendum that was held in Italy on December 4, 2016. A first goal of the analysis was to study how Twitter users expressed their voting intentions about the referendum in the weeks before the voting day, so as to understand how the voting trends have evolved before the vote, e.g., if there have been changes in the voting intentions. According to our study, 48% of Twitter users were polarized toward no, 25% toward yes, and 27% had a neutral behavior. A second goal was to understand the effects of news sites on the referendum campaign. The analysis has shown that some news sites had a strong polarization toward yes (unita.tv, ilsole24ore.it and linkiesta.it), some others had a neutral position (lastampa.it, corriere.it, huffingtonpost.it and repubblica.it) and others were oriented toward no (ilfattoquotidiano.it, ilgiornale.it and beppegrillo.it).

        - **Assumptions**
            - Social media analysis is an important research area aimed at extracting useful information from the big amount of data gathered from social networks.
            - Analyzing the behavior of social network users and news sites can provide insights into political campaigns characterized by the rivalry of different factions.
        - **Methods**
            - pg. 2, Section 2
                - The authors propose a **methodology for analyzing political events **using social media data. The methodology involves **five main steps.
                    - 1: the **definition** of the factions F and collection of the keywords K associated with the political event to be analyzed.
                    - 2: the **collection** of all the posts P generated by social network users containing one or more keywords in K.
                    - 3: the **preprocessing** of P and creation of the input dataset D.
                    - 4: the **data analysis and mining **of dataset D.
                    - 5: the **results visualization**, which is performed by the creation of infographics aimed at presenting the results in a way that is easy to understand to the general public.
            - pg. 4
                - Finally, the authors describe the **design guidelines for the infographics**, which include preferring a visual representation of the quantitative information to the written one, minimizing the cognitive efforts necessary to decoding each system of signs, and structuring the whole proposed elements into graphic hierarchies.
            - pg. 9, Figure 7
                - The authors also describe the** fine-tuning of the model using a grid search over the parameters' space and the use of a Random Forest model** with the entropy criterion and 128 estimators.
        - **Results**
            - pg. 3, Table 1
                - Use a collection of keywords (K) to define political factions (F). These are associated with political events (P).
