    - Title:: Forging Bonds and Burning Bridges: Polarization and Incivility in Blog Discussions About Occupy Wall Street
    - Year:: 2015
    - Author(s):: Elizabeth Suhay, Allyson Blackwell, Cameron Roche, Lucien Bruggeman
    - Abstract:: Putnam warned over a decade ago that the urge to associate with similar others online may lead to “cyberbalkanization,” fostering bonding capital at the expense of bridging capital. This study examines balkanization with respect to political blogs, investigating to what extent opinions in posts and comment sections on blogs associated with the left and right are ideologically polarized. We also investigate whether extreme opinions tend to co-occur with uncivil discourse aimed at political opponents. Finally, this study compares political blogs with a newer information source that bridges the gap between old and new media—newspaper blogs—asking whether polarization and incivility are reduced on that platform. A content analysis was conducted of blog discussions about a salient political event—Occupy Wall Street. In both posts and comments, political blogs were highly polarized and opinion extremity and incivility were correlated. However, content on newspaper blogs was largely unpolarized and civil.

        - **Context**:  investigating to what extent opinions in posts and comment sections on blogs associated with the left and right are ideologically polarized.
            - Research question: Has the internet balkanized (polarized) users?
        - **Key Claims**:
            - We argue here that, though anonymous and virtual communication may play a role in encouraging incivility, incivility online likely also stems from partisan extremity.
            - political polarization among blogs not only prevents bridging capital from being formed but also likely erodes it via frequent incivility toward political opponents, a trend he did not foresee.
        - **Participants and setting**:  case study around the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement

        - **Materials**: Popular political blogs across the political spectrum that were addressing OWS. 5 blogs, 2 from the right, 2 from the left, and one considered moderate. The conversations from the blogs were chosen if they were within the timeframe which represents the height of OWS in the U.S.

            - Stance Towards OWS: contains five levels, with 0 representing solid support for the movement and 1 representing solid opposition to the movement; .5 represents either neutrality or ambivalence.
            - Ideological Social Judgment: This variable contains 11 levels: 0 represents extreme liberal bias, .5 represents no bias (no judgment of left or right or balanced judgment of left and right), and 1 represents extreme conservative bias.
            - Incivility: The Incivility variable has four levels, ranging from 0 to 1.
