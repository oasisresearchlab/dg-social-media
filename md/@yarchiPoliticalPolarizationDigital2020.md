        - Three key aspects of political polarization – **interactional polarization, positional polarization, and affective polarization** – and discuss their interrelation with communication practices specific to different social media.
            - we:
                - (1) examine why social media are believed to contribute to each aspect of polarization;
                - (2) discuss whether each aspect can give rise to possible self-reinforcing tendencies in polarization; and
                - (3) consider the ways in which polarization can be expected to take different shapes on different social media platforms.
            - The first aspect of political polarization, which we call “**interactional polarization**,” focuses on a process whereby participants in a debate increasingly interact with likeminded individuals, while disengaging from interactions with others who hold opposing viewpoints.
            - **Positional Polarization** Beyond fragmentation, political discussion on social media has also been tied to increases in antagonistic and extreme political preferences – the traditional focus of political polarization research (Fiorina & Abrams, 2008), which we refer to here as “positional polarization.” By preferentially exposing users to congenial viewpoints, social media may decrease participants’ awareness to competing views and challenging, possibly corrective information."
            - **“affective polarization”**
                - social media have been argued to contribute to **rising hostility in political talk toward opposing political communication**
            - "...END framework, referring to “the characteristics of a subset of content that circulates in a social media ecosystem: a personalized, quantified blend of politically informative expression, news, and discussion seamlessly interwoven into a wider variety of socially informative content” (p. 50). Settle uses this framework to consider how particular affordances of different social media platforms – e.g., design facilities for identity maintenance, the presentation of political content, the structural importance of opinion leaders, weak ties, social feedback, and quantification – are associated with particular aspects of political polarization. Building on this framework, we will in the following discuss the key implication of such differences for our present investigation.

        - **Case  Study**
            - On March 24, 2016, **two Palestinian assailants stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier near the Westbank town of Hebron. One assailant was shot dead, while the other, Abed al Fatah al-Sharif, was wounded, disarmed, and “neutralized.” Minutes later, IDF Sergeant Elor Azaria shot the incapacitated assailant in the head, killing him.**
            - During the entire process, several representative public opinion polls showed a public split over its evaluation of Azaria and his actions. In a survey conducted in August 2016, 47% of Israelis justified the killing, agreeing that “every Palestinian who has committed an attack on Jews should be killed, even if he is caught and clearly not endangering the environment”; however, another 45% took the opposite view, agreeing that “once he has stopped endangering the environment, the Palestinian perpetrator should be handed over to law enforcement.”
            - "The entire controversy generated considerable amounts of heated discussions, galvanizing the attention of numerous influential speakers at a political level, in the media and on social media over an extended period. By tracking these conversations on different social media over 16 months, using a computational communication science approach, we collected rich data to study interactional polarization over time and across platforms."
