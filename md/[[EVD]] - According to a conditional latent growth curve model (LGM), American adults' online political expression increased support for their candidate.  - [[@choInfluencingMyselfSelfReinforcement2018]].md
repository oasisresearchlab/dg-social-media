        - "We then employed latent growth curve modeling (LGM) to formally test (a) changes over time in intrapersonal repeated measures (i.e., candidate preference; H2a) and (b) the moderation of the growth pattern by interpersonal factors (i.e., political expression; H2b). This technique extracts two latent variables representing "intercept" and "slope by fixing certain coefficient in a structural equation model. Then, two-level modeling is implemented: an unconditional model without predictors (Level 1) and a conditional model with predictors (Level 2). Figure 2 shows the results of the unconditional model.
