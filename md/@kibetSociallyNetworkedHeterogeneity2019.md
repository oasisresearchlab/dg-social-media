                - Claim: WhatsApp reflects social network heterogeneity
                    - Supported by:
                        - Ethnicity, religion, party affiliation, region, class, education positively related to heterogeneity (p<.05) (Results, Table 1)
                    - Opposed by:
                        - Gender negatively related to heterogeneity (not significant) (Results, Table 1)
                - Claim: WhatsApp usage influences social network heterogeneity
                    - Supported by:
                        - Posting news increased heterogeneity by 66% (p<.05) (Results, Table 2)
                        - Discussing politics increased heterogeneity by 48% (p<.05) (Results, Table 2)

                        - Heterogeneity increased ideological polarisation by 0.44 (p<.01) (Results, Table 3)

                - Understanding how social media relates to polarisation in Kenya
                    - (Discussion, para 1)

                    - (Discussion, para 2)
                - Challenges idea that heterogeneity always reduces polarisation
                    - (Discussion, para 2)

                        - "Use of social networking sites on the SNSs network heterogeneity variable was largely influenced by the specific SNS usage patterns of the individual users. The results in Table 2 above interpretatively mean that a 34 per cent increase in the use of WhatsApp for positing news will contribute to a 66 per cent increase in social network heterogeneity."

                            - "The results in Table 3 above, therefore, indicate that polarisation is inevitable in SNS platforms that reflect the composition of the societies that they exist in."

            - ### **Introduction**
                - "Polarisation in Kenya is largely founded on the colonial indiscriminate creation of states during the scramble for Africa. Different ethic groups with varied forms of culture, language, and sociocultural beliefs were huddled together and then expected to establish integrated nation states. Kenya is, therefore, a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-religious, and multi-racial society."
