    - Abstract:: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The rise of “fake news” is a major concern in contemporary Western democracies. Yet, research on the psychological motivations behind the spread of political fake news on social media is surprisingly limited. Are citizens who share fake news <jats:italic>ignorant</jats:italic> and lazy? Are they fueled by sinister motives, seeking to <jats:italic>disrupt</jats:italic> the social status quo? Or do they seek to attack partisan opponents in an increasingly <jats:italic>polarized</jats:italic> political environment? This article is the first to test these competing hypotheses based on a careful mapping of psychological profiles of over 2,300 American Twitter users linked to behavioral sharing data and sentiment analyses of more than 500,000 news story headlines. The findings contradict the ignorance perspective but provide some support for the disruption perspective and strong support for the partisan polarization perspective. Thus, individuals who report hating their political opponents are the most likely to share political fake news and selectively share content that is useful for derogating these opponents. Overall, our findings show that fake news sharing is fueled by the same psychological motivations that drive other forms of partisan behavior, including sharing partisan news from traditional and credible news sources.</jats:p>

        - **Participants and setting**:  2,337 Twitter users in the U.S. who responded to a YouGov survey fielded from mid-December 2018 to mid-January 2019.

        - **Design**: 2,337 Twitter users responded to questions about fake news sharing predictors and demographics on a survey. They had their tweets posted until mid-January 2019 scraped. The links tweeted were compared to a list of real news publishers. The headlines were compared to the universe of headlines popular at the time of the tweet. Sentiment analysis were applied to the headlines.
