        - [x] #checked by [[Joel Chan]]
            - **Any relevant CLMs/EVDs to check?**
                - yes!
            - **CLMs conform to style guide: block ref in each CLM below and then use the review CLM node roam template for each to review it:**
                - [[[[CLM]] - Most social media users engage exclusively in either pro- or anti-vaccine information consumption and production.]]
                    - [atomic and generalized]([[CLM]]s are **atomic, generalized assertions** about the world): fixes
                        - [x] reword to remove claim about causation
                            - these are two separate claims: existence of polarization vs. cause of it
                            - i think the last rephrasing in [the screenshot](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdg-social-media-polarization%2FxskJVtcAfp.00.45%20PM.png?alt=media&token=e6b7f2e9-8628-41a6-bb40-5a07d3cda91e) (p.5)) is a pretty good atomization that focuses on the description (vs. cause): "the majority of social media users are active either in pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine communities, but not both"
                    - [positive](**Positive Claims**: We primarily write "positive" CLMs, and deal with "negative" claims by way of evidential opposition (EVD Oppose CLM)): yes
                    - [source referenced in body of CLM page](The body of a [[CLM]] page should **list all sources** that assert that [[CLM]], with quotes/screenshots and page numbers (see the [[CLM]] ((UivKdOrY7)))): yes
                    - [nonredundant with CLMs in master index](**Overlapping Claims**: If CLM asserted by current paper overlaps sufficiently with CLM already in master index, use that instead of making a new one): n/a
                - [[[[CLM]] - Social media users tend to consume a smaller variety of sources on political topics over time.]]
                    - [atomic and generalized]([[CLM]]s are **atomic, generalized assertions** about the world): yes
                        - though during synthesis i might rephrase this to "social media users tend to consume a smaller variety of sources on political topics over time"

                    - [atomic]([[EVD]] nodes, like CLM nodes, should be **atomic**): yes!
                    - [past tense]([[EVD]] descriptions are written in the **past tense**): yes!
                    - [lower level, contextualized description](**Low Level**: Concepts are described at lower level of abstraction that is **closer to the actual observation**): fixes
                        - [x] add context: fb users, and note that communities are model-estimated (from network analysis)
                    - [methodological clarity](**Methodology clarity**: Key methodological details are described, sufficient to understand the result and appraise its support/opposition for various claims): good!
                - [[[[EVD]] - Longer lifetime and higher levels of activity of Facebook users corresponded with a lesser number of Facebook pages being consumed. - [[@schmidtPolarizationVaccinationDebate2018]]]]

            - **All relevant CLM and EVD mappings described:**
                - good!
            - **General notes**
                - interesting to note the weaker strength of support for the specific EVD on the CLM about smaller variety of sources: EVD is about number of pages, not variety per se!
