        - "...we found through a generalized Fisher's exact test that Twitter users who frequently retweeted hate groups (i.e. at least five times in the span of 9 weeks) were significantly more likely to retweet Trump over any other politician. A significant number of retweeters of nearly all hateful ideologies...were found in Trump's Twitter network."
