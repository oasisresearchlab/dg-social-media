    - Abstract:: There is mounting concern that social media sites contribute to political polarization by creating “echo chambers” that insulate people from opposing views about current events. We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. One week later, we randomly assigned respondents to a treatment condition in which they were offered financial incentives to follow a Twitter bot for 1 month that exposed them to messages from those with opposing political ideologies (e.g., elected officials, opinion leaders, media organizations, and nonprofit groups). Respondents were resurveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment, and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative posttreatment. Democrats exhibited slight increases in liberal attitudes after following a conservative Twitter bot, although these effects are not statistically significant. Notwithstanding important limitations of our study, these findings have significant implications for the interdisciplinary literature on political polarization and the emerging field of computational social science.

            - Not sure if I should move the key claims or just keep them as it is - what do you think Joel?
            - Should I also do the same with the key results?
            - I opted for including the images for the results under key results in the scratchpad
            - "Analysis" should be included in "outcome measure". -- Joel has it as a separate section.

        - **Context**: Growing concern over social media because of social network "homophily" and the creation of "echo chambers", that is patterns of information that reinforce preexisting political beliefs and limit exposure to contrasting political views.
        - **Key claims**:
            - Disrupting selective exposure to partisan information will decrease political polarization because of intergroup contact effects.
