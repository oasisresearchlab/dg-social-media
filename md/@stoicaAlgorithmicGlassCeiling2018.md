    - Title:: Algorithmic Glass Ceiling in Social Networks: The effects of social recommendations on network diversity
    - Year:: 2018
    - Author(s):: Ana-Andreea Stoica, Christopher Riederer, Augustin Chaintreau
    - Abstract:: As social recommendations such as friend suggestions and people to follow become increasingly popular and influential on the growth of social media, we find that prominent social recommendation algorithms can exacerbate the under-representation of certain demographic groups at the top of the social hierarchy. To study this imbalance in online equal opportunities, we leverage new Instagram data and offer for the first time an analysis that studies the effect of gender, homophily and growth dynamics under social recommendations. Our mathematical analysis demonstrates the existence of an algorithmic glass ceiling that exhibits all the properties of the metaphorical social barrier that hinders groups like women or people of color from attaining equal representation. What raises concern is that our proof shows that under fixed minority and homophily parameters the algorithmic effect is systematically larger than the glass ceiling generated by the spontaneous growth of social networks. We discuss ways to address this concern in future design.

        - **Assumptions**
            - pgs. 1-2
                - Social networks exhibit _homophily_, where users tend to connect with similar others (p.1)
                - Recommendation algorithms leverage _network structure_ and can _alter user behavior_ (p.1)
                - Measures of individual wealth in networks correspond to degree centrality (number of connections) (p.2)
        - **Questions**
            - pg. 1
                - Do recommendation algorithms exacerbate or alleviate demographic disparities observed in organic network growth?
                    - pg. 1
                        - "...are there safe (respectively unsafe) conditions under which a well-known metric of disparate impact is no worse (respectively strictly worse) for algorithmic growth that for organic growth?
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdg-social-media-polarization%2FjojAQ-onvS.png?alt=media&token=214275a9-8467-4ec0-8cb8-3f35edbfdc2d)
                - Can the metaphorical "glass ceiling" limiting opportunities for minority groups be replicated in an algorithmic form? (p.1)
        - **Methods**
            - [[big data]] analysis: web crawl of Instagram
                - pgs. 2-3
                    - Constructed graph of 553k users from likes and comments on randomly sampled 1M photos
                    - Compared degree distributions by gender for original graph vs. graphs expanded via recommendation algorithms
                    - Collected dataset of 115M Instagram photos from 245k users over 2014-2015. Inferred gender for 93k users

        - **Evidence**
            - Organic Instagram growth shows slight underrepresentation of women among top degrees (top 0.1%, 500 nodes), indicative of glass ceiling (p.2-3, Figure 1a). Like the degree distribution of WNBA players versus NBA players showing fewer stars.
                - pg. 3
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdg-social-media-polarization%2FlfSMQqcRA8.png?alt=media&token=cd02781f-58fe-41d1-908d-dd3833a4bcdf)
            - Theorem 5.2 proves the degree distributions follow power laws but with different exponents. The majority group's power law decays slower, like the NBA example. This mathematically shows the glass ceiling effect (p.5).
            - Table 1 shows women underrepresented among top Instagram degrees, indicative of glass ceiling (p.3)
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdg-social-media-polarization%2FqTmQU7nXAw.png?alt=media&token=730295ae-28e5-481b-8a43-221be5c53b5a)
            - Table 2 shows recommendations greatly amplify underrepresentation of women, exacerbating glass ceiling effect (p.3)
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdg-social-media-polarization%2FIIoYMEeGeO.png?alt=media&token=111fdcf7-8cf0-4648-aa3b-10c69ed36cba)
            - Figure 1 visualizes how recommendations drastically reduce female fraction at top degrees on Instagram and DBLP, showing algorithmic glass ceiling effect (pgs. 3-4)

                - After recommendations, sharp drop in female representation at top degrees, algorithmic glass ceiling effect (p.3, Figure 1a).
            - Analytical model proves recommendations worsen inequality between groups beyond organic growth (p.4-5)
            - Lemma 5.1 shows fraction of edges to minority converges to less than their population fraction (p.7). Like only 15% edges to left-handed people who are 20% of population.

            - Lemma 5.4 shows recommendations reduce fraction of edges to minority versus baseline model (p.6). Like making network more biased against left-handed people.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdg-social-media-polarization%2F8r2o7mH2sc.png?alt=media&token=5ca55211-0264-41df-8f0a-388b69305c32)
            - Extensions show reversing inequality requires accounting for differential homophily across groups (p.6)
        - **Claims**
            - Evidence of metaphorical glass ceiling limiting women on Instagram (p.2-3)
            - Recommendations substantially amplify the glass ceiling effect
                - pg. 1
                    - "...using empirical evidence from newly collected data on Instagram and a rigorous analysis of mathematical models, we prove that prominent recommender algorithms reinforce the _rate at which disparity grows_."

            - We can formalize the algorithmic glass ceiling effect
                - pg. 9
                    - "We have thus formalized the algorithmic class ceiling effect in a network that undergoes recommendation."

            - It is not really possible to mitigate the glass ceiling bias in most contexts (pg. 1).

        - **New Questions**
            - How do other algorithms such as _collaborative filtering_ affect bias?
            - Which user interface _designs help correct algorithmic bias_?
            - How can _differential homophily_ be _inferred_ from network data?
