    - Title:: Testing popular news discourse on the “echo chamber” effect: Does political polarisation occur among those relying on social media as their primary politics news source?
    - Year:: 2019
    - Author(s):: An Nguyen, Hong Tien Vu
    - Abstract:: <jats:p>Since 2016, online social networks (OSNs), especially their “big data” algorithms, have been intensively blamed in popular news discourse for acting as echo chambers. These chambers entrap like-minded voters in closed ideological circles that cause serious damage to democratic processes. This study examines this “echo chamber” argument through the rather divisive case of EU politics among EU citizens. Based on an exploratory secondary analysis of the Eurobarometer 86.2 survey dataset, we investigate whether the reliance on OSNs as a primary EU political news source can lead people to more polarisation in EU-related political beliefs and attitudes than a reliance on traditional media. We found little evidence for this polarisation, lending credence to a rejection of social media’s “echo chamber” effect.</jats:p>

                        - [x] could be generalized away from the EU context to connect with other CLMs
                            - i think this is partly bc this is a rephrasing of hte hypothesis (which I can see from screenshot, thanks!), which tends to be much lower-level, similar to EVD
                            - better one for cross-connection might be from discussion (i think this is generally good idea): "algorithmic curation on online social networks engenders more political polarisation than traditional media"

                    - [positive](**Positive Claims**: We primarily write "positive" CLMs, and deal with "negative" claims by way of evidential opposition (EVD Oppose CLM)): yes!
                    - [source referenced in body of CLM page](The body of a [[CLM]] page should **list all sources** that assert that [[CLM]], with quotes/screenshots and page numbers (see the [[CLM]] ((UivKdOrY7)))): some fixes requested

                            - for those with positive predisposition towards EU, no significant differences in degree of positive sentiment on EU issues for people for whom OSN was primary news source (vs. other traditional media)

                        - [x] note that this was positivity/negativity towards specific EU issues
