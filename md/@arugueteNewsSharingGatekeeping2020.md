    - Title:: News Sharing, Gatekeeping, and Polarization: A Study of the #Bolsonaro Election
    - Year:: 2020
    - Author(s):: Natalia Aruguete, Ernesto Calvo, Tiago Ventura
    - Abstract:: The increasing importance of news sharing, and its effect on the routines, practices, and values described by the hierarchy of influences model, raises new questions about content creation in polarized social media environments. How does news sharing change the gatekeeping preferences of news organizations? Will polarized users polarize news organizations further?
In this article, we model news sharing behavior in social media and derive implications for the study of gatekeeping in political communication. We model usersâ€™ news sharing behavior using observational data from Twitter and then use the parameters from our model to explain its effect on editorial gatekeeping. The article provides a road map for researchers interested
in the relationship between these major theories in political communication. We test our model using Twitter data collected during the election of populist leader Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.

Both groups largely share content from large/more reputable outlets, while usually only one group is inclined to share content from smaller/less reputable outlets.

                - [[[[EVD]] - Activation largely varied depending on outlet reputation. Larger news organizations were shared widely across users from different ideologies. Smaller outlets were narrowly linked to a specific group.

                    - The plots show the influence of ideology on user engagement, with larger negative values indicating greater importance. Each dot represents each "share" of content. Blue dots are Bolsonaro supporters and Red dots are opposition supporters. Figure A consists of larger/more reputable outlets. Figure B consists of smaller/less reputable outlets. Both groups largely share content from large/more reputable outlets, while usually only one group is inclined to share content from smaller/less reputable outlets.

                        - The methodology for the final classification of outlet reputation is not clear. There is an estimate of reputation in Figure 8, but it is not clear how that was assessed. Besides, Figure 8 does not reflect the final classification pictured in Figures 6a and 6b. It seems that "More Reputable News Organizations" refers to traditional media outlets, and "Less Reputable News Organizations" to the remaining outlets.
