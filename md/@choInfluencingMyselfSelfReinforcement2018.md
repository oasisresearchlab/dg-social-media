    - Abstract:: Over the past decade, various online communication platforms have empowered citizens to express themselves politically. Although the political impact of online citizen expression has drawn considerable attention, research has largely focused on whether and how citizen-generated messages influence the public as an information alternative to traditional news outlets. The present study aims to provide a new perspective on understanding citizen expression by examining its political implications for the expressers themselves rather than those exposed to the expressed ideas. Data from a national survey and an online discussion forum study suggest that expressing oneself about politics provides self-reinforcing feedback. Political expressions on social media and the online forum were found to (a) reinforce the expressers’ partisan thought process and (b) harden their pre-existing political preferences. Implications for the role the Internet plays in democracy will be discussed.

            - Here is a nested outline for the Cho et al. research article:
            - **Assumptions:**
                - **Theoretical assumption**: Expressing political views reinforces individuals' prior partisan thought processes and political preferences (p. 84, para 2-3)
                - **Theoretical assumption**: Political expression involves intrapersonal reasoning that aligns ideas with pre-existing orientations (p. 87, para 3)
                - **Theoretical assumption**: After expressing views publicly, individuals feel committed to remain consistent due to self-perception and cognitive dissonance (p. 88-89)
                - Page 84, paragraph 2-3: "Research suggests that engaging in political conversation reinforces individuals’ pre-existing partisan disposition. Psychological biases (e.g., homophily) in communication processes primarily account for the partisan reinforcement caused by political conversation."
                - Page 87, paragraph 3: "We thus postulate that the intrapersonal cognitive elaboration before and during expression is an opportunity to organize and augment one’s prior attitudes, unless the domains of thought are highly sensitive politically or involve concerns of social desirability."
                - Page 88-89: "Taken together, we posit that expressing oneself has self-constraining effects on the part of the expresser, committing them further to what they have said. This happens both through internal mechanisms (i.e., self-perception and dissonance avoidance) and perceived social pressure toward self-commitment."
            - **Questions and hypotheses:**
                - **Question**: Does expressing political views on social media reinforce partisan thought processes? (p. 90)
                    - Hypothesis 1: As political expression on social media increases, the impact of party identification on political opinions will become stronger. (p. 90)
                - **Question**: Does expressing political views online reinforce individuals' political preferences over time? (p. 96)
                    - Hypothesis 2a: Individuals' candidate preferences will become more stable as Election Day approaches. (p. 96)
                    - Hypothesis 2b: The pattern of growing preference for a candidate will become stronger with more online political expression. (p. 96)
            - **Prior literature:**
                - Political discussion with like-minded others reinforces partisan dispositions (p. 84-85)
                - Online political discussion varies in selectivity - some studies show cross-cutting exposure while others show segregation (p. 85-87)
                - Political expression involves clarifying thoughts which can have deliberative benefits (p. 87, para 2)
                - Routinely, political expression reflects individuals' dispositions more than impartial reasoning (p. 87, para 3)
            - **Knowledge gaps: **
                - Unclear whether political expression uniquely affects expressers' opinions (p. 102, para 2)
                - Unknown how tone and emotions resulting from expression may moderate its effects (p. 104-105)
                - **Methods:**

                        - Measures: Candidate preferences, posting/reading on forum (p. 97)

            - **Claims and Results/Evidence:** - had to redo this chunk
                - Political expression strengthens alignment between partisan identities and political opinions.
                    - Supported by
                        - According to regression analysis, the relationship between party ID and political opinions grew stronger as social media political expression increased, after controlling for political engagement and discussion (Table 1; p. 92-93).
                - Political expression reinforces individuals' political preferences over time.
                    - Supported by
                        - According to latent growth curve modeling, individuals' relative candidate preferences increased over time, and this pattern of preference stability was greater for those with more online political expression (Figure 3; p. 100-101).
                - Online political expression increases political engagement.
                    - Supported by
                        - Political expression on social media was positively associated with political engagement, including behaviors like political discussion online, voting, and petition signing (p. 90-91).
                    - Opposed by
                        - According to latent growth curve modeling, reading others' posts on the online forum was not associated with changes in relative candidate preferences over time (p. 101).
            - **Practical implications:  **
                - Political expression online may increase confidence in views but also contribute to polarization (p. 103, para 2)
                - Social media's participatory culture may entrench partisan divides rather than foster deliberation (p. 103, para 3)
            - **Theoretical & ontological implications: **
                - Political expression can affect opinion formation of expressers, not just message recipients (p. 102, para 1)
                - Expression and exposure effects should be considered separately in political discussion (p. 102, para 2)
                - Features of expression like tone may change its outcomes, complicating the observed effects (p. 104-105)
            - **Limitations:**
                - Data collected in different countries (South Korea and U.S.) may confound results (p. 104, para 1)
                - Expression effects tested based only on frequency, not content features (p. 104, para 2)
            - **Future research:**
                - Test expression effects separating unique variance from reading others' posts (p. 101, para 5)
                - Examine whether tone and emotions resulting from expression moderate its effects (p. 105)
                - Replicate findings in a single cultural context (p. 104-105)
