        - "Figure 7 shows the classification performance achieved by RF models at different times. In particular...classification performance of 0.849 plus or minus 0.006 and 0.82 plus or minus 0.006. Such a classification performance increases with the amount of information available, reaching the value of 0.962 plus or minus 0.002 and 0.949 plus or minus 0.001 1 week before the referendum day."
